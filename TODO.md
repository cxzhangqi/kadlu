### TODO:
##### - with some comments to discuss during code review as subpoints

- [ ] Exception module
    - [ ] Identify list of exceptions to be caught / addressed within scope of software
- [ ] Creating analogue to bathy_reader for wave data
    - [ ] wave_fetch -- retrieval of data to "read"
        - [x] Implement storage configuration
            - [x] Identify means of user specification of storage space 
               - this is now defined in config.ini
            - [x] Reference user specified storage space within fetch functions 
                - see functionality added inside wave_fetch.init
                - [x] Fix function headers referencing storage 
                    - this functionality has changed - see parent bulletpoint
            - [ ] Verify source is a wave source
                - following the comments that existed wave_fetch.init -- how to verify?
        - [ ] Add fetch handler for DalCoast data
            - function stubs added, requires data source
        - [ ] Modify all fetch modules to simultaneously fetch 3 parameters (or N parameters as more are integrated into modeling)
            - This follows the idea of whether or not to "generalize" the fetching
            - it might include a target_date handler to abstract either the nearest date or nearest date interval
        - [ ] Tidy comments / re-check for comments requesting fixes / modifications
        - [x] Migrate test cases in main () out to either:
            - [x] CI elements
            - [ ] ~~Guides within python notebooks~~
                - migrated to CI elements instead, but could do this also if it would help someone
    - [ ] wave_reader module
        - [ ] Generalize extraction from GRIB to match with needs of model component (to be provided)
            - generalization of reader follows generalization of fetch (?)
- [ ] Generalize fetch method within wave_fetch 
    - [ ] to handle bathymetry
        - requires data source
    - [ ] to handle temperature and salinity
        - requires data source
