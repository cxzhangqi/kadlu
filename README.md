This library contains tools for the implementation of MERIDIAN's Acoustic Field Model.
This includes tools for:

 * Retrieval of relevant environmental data such bathymetry and seabed properties 
   (static) and water temperature and salinity (dynamic)

 * Derivation of acoustic properties (such as sound speed) from environmental data 
   and conversion into format suitable for sound propagation modelling 

 * Retrieval and processing of AIS data

 * Simulation of the noise spectra generated by ships (sound intensity, frequency distribution and potentially also directionality)

 * Calculation of sound propagation from source to receiver

And potentially more ...

The [arlpy](https://github.com/org-arl/arlpy) package may provide a useful starting point.
