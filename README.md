Welcome to the Ocean Soundscape Toolbox python package (pyost). 
This package is currently under development, but will eventually 
contain a bunch of tools useful for modeling the underwater ocean 
soundscapes, for example:

 * Automated retrieval of relevant environmental data, including static 
   data such as bathymetry and seabed properties, and dynamic data such 
   as water temperature, salinity, and wave height.

 * Derivation of underwater acoustic properties (such as sound speed) from 
   the environmental data and conversion into format suitable for sound 
   propagation modelling.

 * Simulation of underwater noise produced by environmental forcings 
   such as waves and rain.

 * Retrieval and processing of AIS data (ship position data).

 * Simulation of underwater noise produced by ships.

And potentially more ...

Some of these features can already be found in the [arlpy](https://github.com/org-arl/arlpy) package.
